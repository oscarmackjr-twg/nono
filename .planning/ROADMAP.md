### 🏗️ v2.3 Linux POC Unblock + Deferreds Closure (Phases 25–29) — IN PROGRESS

**Goal:** A Linux user running fork-Linux-build sees real enforcement (not silent no-ops) for `--memory` / `--cpu-percent` / `--timeout` / `--max-processes`, and v2.2's deferred items (PKG streaming, audit-attestation hardening, Authenticode chain-walker) ship as production-ready surfaces.

**Trigger:** Linux POC gap analysis (2026-04-29, `.planning/quick/260429-gap-v039-linux-poc-vs-windows-fork-tip/PLAN.md`) showed RESL flags emit "not enforced on linux" warnings — credibility issue for the demo. v2.3 closes those + lands the WR-01 product decision deferred since v2.1.

**Requirement coverage:** 14 requirements across 6 categories (RESL-NIX, AIPC-NIX, PKGS, AAH, AUDC, WRU). All mapped; zero orphans.

- [ ] **Phase 25: Cross-Platform RESL + AIPC Unix Design** (2 plans, candidate from gap-analysis quick task) — REQ-RESL-NIX-01..03 + REQ-AIPC-NIX-01. Plan 25-01 lands cgroup v2 (Linux) + setrlimit (macOS) backends; Plan 25-02 ships an AIPC Unix futures ADR documenting which 5 HandleKinds admit Unix backends. Subsumes v2.3 backlog row "Cross-platform RESL Unix backends" verbatim.
- [ ] **Phase 26: PKG Streaming Follow-Up** (1–2 plans TBD) — REQ-PKGS-01..04. Lands the 2 deferred upstream cherry-picks (`58b5a24e` `validate_relative_path`, `9ebad89a` streaming refactor) plus the architectural decisions skipped in v2.2 Plan 22-03 (`ArtifactType::Plugin` variant, `bundle_json` field, `validate_path_within` belt-and-suspenders, `load_registry_profile` auto-pull from `115b5cfa`).
- [ ] **Phase 27: Audit-Attestation Hardening** (1 plan) — REQ-AAH-01. Re-enables 2 `#[ignore]`'d fixture-driven tests via Rule-4 architectural decision: sigstore-rs upgrade vs fork-internal pkcs8 parser. Required before publishing v2.2 attestation as production-ready.
- [ ] **Phase 28: Authenticode Chain-Walker Subject Extraction** (1 plan) — REQ-AUDC-01..03. Adds `Win32_Security_Cryptography_Catalog` + `Win32_Security_Cryptography_Sip` features to `windows-sys`; implements `parse_signer_subject` + `parse_thumbprint`; re-enables `authenticode_signed_records_subject` test; upgrades AUD-03 acceptance to require populated subject + thumbprint on Valid signature.
- [ ] **Phase 29: WR-01 Reject-Stage Unification** (1 plan) — REQ-WRU-01..02. Product decision: align all 5 AIPC HandleKinds on a single reject stage *or* lock the asymmetry as permanent design property with explicit rationale. Updates `wr01_*` regression tests + Phase 23 `RejectStage` ledger emission per the chosen verdict matrix.

## Phase Details (v2.3)

### Phase 25: Cross-Platform RESL + AIPC Unix Design

**Goal:** Convert silent-no-op RESL flags on Linux/macOS into kernel-level enforcement (cgroup v2 / `setrlimit`), and ship an ADR documenting which AIPC HandleKinds admit Unix backends.

**Depends on:** None structurally. v2.1 Phase 16 (Windows RESL) provides the reference acceptance shape.

**Requirements:** REQ-RESL-NIX-01, REQ-RESL-NIX-02, REQ-RESL-NIX-03, REQ-AIPC-NIX-01 (4 reqs).

**Plans (planned):** 2

1. **Plan 25-01 — Cross-platform RESL Unix backends.** Linux cgroup v2 (`memory.max` / `cpu.max` / `pids.max` / `cgroup.kill`); macOS `setrlimit` (`RLIMIT_AS` / `RLIMIT_NPROC`; `RLIMIT_CPU` documented gap; `--cpu-percent` fail-closed unsupported on macOS). Removes 4 "not enforced on linux" stderr warnings. Reuses v2.1 Phase 16 acceptance shape.
2. **Plan 25-02 — AIPC Unix futures ADR.** Design-only document at `docs/architecture/aipc-unix-futures.md` (or equivalent). Decision per-HandleKind: Socket/Pipe admit Unix backends via Unix-domain socket + `SCM_RIGHTS`; JobObject/Event/Mutex are Windows-only by design. Cross-linked from PROJECT.md.

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE when Phase 25 completes):

1. A Linux user running `nono run --memory 256m -- bash -c "tail -c 1G </dev/urandom"` sees the child OOM-killed by cgroup v2 `memory.max`; `nono inspect <id>` shows `memory_kill: true`.
2. A Linux user running `nono run --max-processes 10 -- ...` sees fork failures after 10 processes (`pids.max`).
3. A macOS user running `nono run --memory 256m -- ...` sees the child aborted via `RLIMIT_AS` mmap failure.
4. None of the four "not enforced on linux" / "not enforced on macos" warnings emit on the supported flag set after this phase lands.
5. `docs/architecture/aipc-unix-futures.md` (or equivalent ADR) committed; PROJECT.md cross-links it; each of 5 HandleKinds has a yes/no verdict with rationale.

### Phase 26: PKG Streaming Follow-Up

**Goal:** Land the 2 PKG cherry-picks deferred from v2.2 Plan 22-03 plus the architectural decisions that blocked them.

**Depends on:** v2.2 Phase 22 Plan 22-03 (provides the 6/8 cherry-picks already landed).

**Requirements:** REQ-PKGS-01..04 (4 reqs).

**Plans:** TBD (1–2 plans; final count locked at `/gsd-plan-phase 26`).

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE when Phase 26 completes):

1. `nono pull <large-artifact>` of 200MB succeeds via streaming (memory profile peaks at ~10MB).
2. Pack manifest with `..` traversal rejected by both `validate_relative_path` (input-string) and `validate_path_within` (canonicalize-and-compare); deferred-divergence comment at `package_cmd.rs:631-643` resolved.
3. Profile extending `registry://vendor/pack@1.2.3` auto-pulls absent packs idempotently.
4. `ArtifactType::Plugin` variant deserializes; round-trips through `serde_json`.

### Phase 27: Audit-Attestation Hardening

**Goal:** Re-enable 2 `#[ignore]`'d fixture-driven tests in `crates/nono-cli/tests/audit_attestation.rs`; resolve the Rule-4 architectural decision (sigstore-rs upgrade vs fork-internal pkcs8 parser).

**Depends on:** v2.2 Plan 22-05a (provides the cryptographic DSSE bundle verification; the deferred tests sit on top).

**Requirements:** REQ-AAH-01 (1 req).

**Plans:** 1 (locked at `/gsd-plan-phase 27`).

**Success Criteria:**

1. Both `#[ignore]`'d tests run and pass.
2. Architectural decision documented in CONTEXT.md with cascade impact for future readers.
3. `cargo test -p nono-cli --test audit_attestation` exits 0 with no ignored tests.

### Phase 28: Authenticode Chain-Walker Subject Extraction

**Goal:** Light up `parse_signer_subject` + `parse_thumbprint` on Windows; upgrade AUD-03 acceptance to require populated subject + non-empty thumbprint on `Valid` Authenticode signatures.

**Depends on:** v2.2 Plan 22-05b (provides the discriminant-only Authenticode integration; chain walker sits on top).

**Requirements:** REQ-AUDC-01, REQ-AUDC-02, REQ-AUDC-03 (3 reqs).

**Plans:** 1 (locked at `/gsd-plan-phase 28`).

**Success Criteria:**

1. `nono audit show <id>` on Windows for a signed binary shows populated `signer_subject` (CN substring) + non-empty 40-char hex SHA-1 thumbprint.
2. Chain-walk failure on `Valid` signature → audit-recording fail-closed (no silent `<unknown>` substitution).
3. `authenticode_signed_records_subject` test re-enabled and passing.

### Phase 29: WR-01 Reject-Stage Unification

**Goal:** Ship the product decision on AIPC HandleKind reject-stage (BEFORE vs AFTER prompt asymmetry deferred since v2.1) and update `wr01_*` regression tests + Phase 23 `RejectStage` ledger emission per the chosen verdict matrix.

**Depends on:** v2.1 Phase 18.1 (locks asymmetry in `wr01_*` tests); v2.2 Phase 23 (mirrors asymmetry on the audit-ledger wire via `RejectStage`).

**Requirements:** REQ-WRU-01, REQ-WRU-02 (2 reqs).

**Plans:** 1 (locked at `/gsd-plan-phase 29`).

**Success Criteria:**

1. CONTEXT D-14 (or equivalent ADR) updated with chosen option + rationale.
2. All 5 `wr01_*` tests pass with assertions matching the chosen matrix.
3. `audit_integrity_records_5_handle_kinds_in_ledger` (Phase 23 multi-kind E2E) passes; ledger reflects the chosen matrix.
4. PROJECT.md key-decisions table updated.

## Backlog (v2.4 carry-forward)

The four major v2.2-deferred items (PKG streaming, audit-attestation hardening, Authenticode chain-walker, WR-01 reject-stage unification, cross-platform RESL Unix backends) have been pulled into v2.3 as Phases 25–29. The backlog below is what remains for v2.4+.

- **Upstream v0.41–v0.43 ingestion** (deferred from v2.3 scope-lock 2026-04-29). Use the DRIFT-01/02 tooling shipped in v2.2 Phase 24 (`make check-upstream-drift`) for first real load. Skipped in v2.3 to keep the milestone shippable in 2 weeks; the tooling stays warm regardless.

- **AIPC G-04 wire-protocol compile-time tightening** (deferred from v2.1 Plan 18.1-02; reaffirmed at v2.3 scope-lock). `Approved(ResourceGrant)` inline at the wire type so `(Approved, grant=None)` becomes a compile-time error. Cascades into `aipc_sdk.rs` child SDK demultiplexer + 23 pre-existing tests. Out of v2.3 scope due to test-cascade size.

- **`windows-squash` → `main` merge** (re-deferred 2026-04-29 per quick-260428-rsu). Gated on PR-583 maintainer response; cannot be pulled into v2.3 until that gate moves. Tracked separately as a quick task; not a milestone phase.

- **Cross-platform drift QA** (new, deferred from v2.3 scope-lock). After Phase 25 RESL Unix backends land, validate full Linux/macOS test-suite passes against fork tip. Bundle with v2.4 upstream-ingestion work.

- **Docs pass for v2.2 + v2.3 surfaces** (deferred from v2.3 scope-lock). Bring `docs/cli/*` Mintlify content current with audit-integrity, package management, OAuth2 proxy, RESL Unix backends. Bundle with v2.4 upstream-ingestion work.

- **WR-02 EDR HUMAN-UAT item** (v3.0). Requires EDR-instrumented runner; no host available.
