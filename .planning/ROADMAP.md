### 🏗️ v2.2 Windows/macOS Parity Sweep (Phases 22–24) — IN PROGRESS

**Goal:** When v2.2 ships, a Windows user and a macOS user have the same `nono` commands available with the same flags and the same security guarantees. Close the current Windows-vs-macOS drift caused by upstream shipping v0.38 → v0.40 without Windows ports, and install a drift-prevention process so v0.42+ don't recreate the gap.

**Pre-milestone (not a v2.2 phase):** Merge `windows-squash` → `main` — separate quick task. Must land before Phase 22 cherry-picks begin so upstream parity work targets stable mainline.

**Requirement coverage:** 21 requirements across 6 categories (PROF, POLY, PKG, OAUTH, AUD, DRIFT). All mapped; zero orphans.

- [ ] **Phase 22: UPST2 — Upstream v0.38–v0.40 Parity Sync** (0/5 plans) — ingest cross-platform feature clusters (profile struct, policy tightening, package manager, OAuth2 proxy, audit integrity) with Windows parity in lockstep
- [ ] **Phase 23: Windows Audit-Event Retrofit** (0/1 plan) — wire Windows supervisor's 5 AIPC broker paths (File, Socket, Pipe, JobObject, Event, Mutex) into the Phase 22-05 ledger
- [ ] **Phase 24: Parity-Drift Prevention** (0/2 plans) — `scripts/check-upstream-drift` tooling + GSD quick-task template for upstream-sync cadence

## Phase Details

### Phase 22: UPST2 — Upstream v0.38–v0.40 Parity Sync

**Goal:** Windows users run every cross-platform feature upstream shipped in v0.38–v0.40 with the same flags, same guarantees, and same failure modes as macOS users.

**Depends on:** Pre-milestone `windows-squash` → `main` merge (tracked as a separate quick task).

**Requirements:** PROF-01, PROF-02, PROF-03, PROF-04, POLY-01, POLY-02, POLY-03, PKG-01, PKG-02, PKG-03, PKG-04, OAUTH-01, OAUTH-02, OAUTH-03, AUD-01, AUD-02, AUD-03, AUD-04 (18 requirements).

**Plans** (locked sequencing, mirrors v2.1 Phase 20 UPST-01..04 pattern):

1. **Plan 22-01 — Profile struct alignment** (PROF-01..04). Lowest risk: deserialize-only changes to `Profile` struct (`unsafe_macos_seatbelt_rules`, `packs`, `command_args`, `custom_credentials.oauth2`) + ship `claude-no-keychain` built-in. Prerequisite for plans 22-03 (packs in profile) and 22-04 (`oauth2` parse).
2. **Plan 22-02 — Policy tightening** (POLY-01..03). Breaking CLI contract, small surface: orphan `override_deny` fails load; `--rollback` + `--no-audit` rejected; `.claude.lock` → `allow_file`. Independent of 22-01; can wave-parallel.
3. **Plan 22-03 — Package manager + packs** (PKG-01..04). New `nono package pull/remove/search/list` subcommand tree with Windows `%LOCALAPPDATA%` + long-path handling, hook registration via fork's `hooks.rs`, signed-artifact streaming download. Depends on Plan 22-01 (profile deserializes `packs`).
4. **Plan 22-04 — OAuth2 proxy + reverse-proxy upstream gating** (OAUTH-01..03). Port `OAuth2Config` + `nono-proxy/src/oauth2.rs` + `reverse.rs` HTTP-upstream loopback-only gating + `--allow-domain` strict-proxy composition. Depends on Plan 22-01 (profile deserializes `custom_credentials.oauth2`).
5. **Plan 22-05 — Audit integrity + attestation** (AUD-01..04). Highest risk, LAST: ~1.4k LOC port touching `rollback_runtime.rs` (+586 upstream), `supervised_runtime.rs` (+42), `exec_strategy.rs` (+144) — all heavily forked on `windows-squash`. Windows exec-identity via `GetModuleFileNameW` + Authenticode. `prune` → `session cleanup` rename preserves v2.1 Phase 19 CLEAN-04 invariants (`NONO_CAP_FILE` structural no-op, require-suffix `--older-than`, 100-file auto-sweep).

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE when Phase 22 completes):

1. A Windows user running `nono run --profile <any-cross-platform-profile> -- <cmd>` sees profile JSON containing `unsafe_macos_seatbelt_rules`, `packs`, `command_args`, or `custom_credentials.oauth2` fields parse without error — the same profiles macOS users already run today.
2. A Windows user running `nono run --rollback --no-audit -- <cmd>` or loading a profile with an orphan `override_deny` entry sees a fail-closed error at CLI parse / profile load time, matching macOS behavior.
3. A Windows user runs `nono package pull <name>` / `remove` / `search` / `list` and sees identical behavior to a macOS user on the same registry, with artifacts landing under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\nono\packages\<name>` and hooks registered through Claude Code.
4. A Windows user running `nono run --profile <with-oauth2> -- curl https://api.example.com` receives a `Bearer` token on the outbound request with the same token-cache + refresh semantics as macOS.
5. A Windows user running `nono run --audit-integrity --audit-sign-key <ref> -- <cmd>` produces a session with a populated `chain_head`, `merkle_root`, and `audit-attestation.bundle`, and `nono audit verify <id>` succeeds — all equivalent to macOS; v2.1 CLEAN-04 regressions (`auto_prune_is_noop_when_sandboxed`, suffix-required `--older-than`) still pass after the `prune` → `session cleanup` rename.

**Rationale for ordering:** 22-01 unblocks 22-03 + 22-04 via the profile struct changes. 22-05 must run last because its file-level overlap (`rollback_runtime.rs`, `supervised_runtime.rs`, `exec_strategy.rs`) is maximally forked on `windows-squash` — resolving those conflicts after 22-01..04 have stabilized the surrounding code minimizes re-work. 22-02 is independent and can land any time in the window.

**Plans:** TBD (drafted during `/gsd-plan-phase 22`)

### Phase 23: Windows Audit-Event Retrofit

**Goal:** A Windows user who inspects an audit session via `nono audit show <id>` sees supervisor decisions for every AIPC broker path recorded with the same structured shape macOS uses for its equivalent capability events.

**Depends on:** Phase 22 (specifically Plan 22-05, which lands the upstream ledger infrastructure; AUD-05 wires Windows-specific emissions into it).

**Requirements:** AUD-05.

**Plans** (1 plan):

1. **Plan 23-01 — AIPC broker audit emissions** — Thread ledger-append calls into each `handle_*_request` function in `crates/nono-cli/src/exec_strategy_windows/supervisor.rs` (File, Socket, Pipe, JobObject, Event, Mutex). Sanitize payloads via existing `sanitize_for_terminal`. Preserve WR-01 reject-stage asymmetry (BEFORE vs AFTER prompt) but record stage explicitly per event. Survive `AppliedLabelsGuard` Drop flush.

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE when Phase 23 completes):

1. A Windows user running the `aipc-demo.exe` integration test against a `--audit-integrity` session and then `nono audit show <id>` sees one capability-decision event per brokered handle (Event, Mutex, Pipe, Socket, JobObject) with HandleKind, access mask, and target PID.
2. A Windows user whose sandboxed child hits a privileged-port Socket request sees a Denied event with reason string `"broker failed: ... privileged port"` in the ledger — surfaced through `nono audit show` with no credential material leaked.
3. The v2.1-locked `wr01_*` regression tests still pass AND the ledger reflects each kind's reject stage (BEFORE-prompt kinds carry zero-backend-call markers; AFTER-prompt kinds carry one-backend-call markers), with no change to the WR-01 decision itself.

**Rationale:** Kept as a real phase in the roadmap (not collapsed into 22-05) because AUD-05 is a Windows-specific retrofit with a distinct acceptance shape — upstream's ledger covers supervisor events generically, but Windows' AIPC broker paths are fork-only surfaces that need explicit wiring. If Plan 22-05 discovers that the upstream ledger shape already covers AIPC HandleKinds cleanly, Phase 23 may collapse to a no-op closure during `/gsd-plan-phase 23`; for now, landing the requirement in a dedicated phase gives AUD-05 a home and avoids orphaning it.

**Plans:** TBD (drafted during `/gsd-plan-phase 23`)

### Phase 24: Parity-Drift Prevention

**Goal:** A maintainer opening a quick-task for the next upstream release (v0.41.0, v0.42.0, ...) has tooling that inventories the cross-platform commit range and a template that scaffolds a working sync PLAN.md in minutes, not hours.

**Depends on:** None structurally (independent of Phase 22 / 23 execution). Can start any time after Plan 22-01 lands the first plan, since the drift-check script will target v0.38+ commit range for its first real use.

**Requirements:** DRIFT-01, DRIFT-02.

**Plans** (1–2 plans; final count TBD during `/gsd-plan-phase 24`):

1. **Plan 24-01 — Upstream drift-check tooling** (DRIFT-01). `scripts/check-upstream-drift.ps1` + `scripts/check-upstream-drift.sh` report commits in `upstream/main..HEAD` touching cross-platform files (`crates/nono/src/`, `crates/nono-cli/src/` excluding `*_windows.rs`/`exec_strategy_windows/`, `crates/nono-proxy/src/`, `crates/nono/Cargo.toml`). Output groups commits by category (profile, policy, proxy, audit, other) in a table or JSON. Documented in `docs/cli/development/upstream-drift.md`.
2. **Plan 24-02 — GSD upstream-sync template** (DRIFT-02). Reusable template at `.planning/templates/upstream-sync-quick.md` (or equivalent). Scaffold includes: diff-range spec, cherry-pick-per-commit pattern with `Upstream-commit:` trailer, conflict-file inventory, Windows-specific retrofit checklist. Referenced from PROJECT.md.

(Plans may be combined into a single plan at `/gsd-plan-phase 24` if the tooling + template are small enough to land together; split as drafted if the scope diverges.)

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE when Phase 24 completes):

1. A maintainer runs `scripts/check-upstream-drift.sh` against the v0.37.1..v0.40.1 range and gets back a table reproducing the commit inventory from quick task 260424-upr's SUMMARY.md (same commits, same categorization).
2. A maintainer invokes the upstream-sync quick-task template for a hypothetical v0.41.0 sync and gets a functional PLAN.md skeleton with diff-range, conflict-file inventory, and Windows retrofit checklist pre-populated.
3. `docs/cli/development/upstream-drift.md` exists and PROJECT.md references the upstream-sync template — so the next milestone's maintainer doesn't have to rediscover the process from commit archaeology.

**Rationale:** Without this phase, v0.41+ will recreate the Windows-vs-macOS gap v2.2 just closed. The drift-check script + template make upstream absorption a weeks-scale quick task instead of a milestone-scale effort.

**Plans:** TBD (drafted during `/gsd-plan-phase 24`)
